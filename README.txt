This code is written by Dr Steven White, CEH Wallingford (smwhit@ceh.ac.uk).  It accompanies the paper "Mechanistic Model for Predicting the Seasonal Abundance of Culicoides Biting Midges and the Impacts of Insecticide Control" which is currently under review (25/10/2106).

The matlab code simulates a mechanistic midge model to predict the abundance of midges at a given location. 

The code has been tested on Matlab R2014b and requires the statistics toolbox to run.

There are three associated files which contain site specific daily data on air temperature, soil temperature and photoperiod. I have provided example data for this repository, but you can use your own data and modify the code if you wish.
